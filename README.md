# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
The overview of this project was to continue the original analysis that involved using API weather data to create a map and recommend trips for clients. This challenge involved using the weather description data to enhance the "PlanMyTrip app". I could then identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I createD a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
